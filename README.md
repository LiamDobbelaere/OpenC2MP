**Note: this project is not ready for use**

OpenC2MP is a to-be alternative to C2O (Carmageddon 2 Online, created by Wolverine). Wolverine has done a lot of impressive work for C2O, figuring out process memory locations and writing a client/server to allow for online play in Carmageddon 2.

To respect their copyright, C2MP does not come with CppWrapper.dll or any of Wolverine's original work. You must install C2O first to be able to use C2MP (see https://rr2000.cwaboard.co.uk/ for C2O's installer).
